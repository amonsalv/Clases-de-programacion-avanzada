## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the local development environment:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/amonsalv/Clases-de-programacion-avanzada.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Clases-de-programacion-avanzada
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into folders, each corresponding to a specific topic. Within each folder, you will find exercise files that you need to complete.

Here's an overview of the repository structure:

```
├── topic1/
│   ├── exercise1.js
│   ├── exercise2.js
│   └── ...
├── topic2/
│   ├── exercise1.js
│   ├── exercise2.js
│   └── ...
├── topic3/
│   ├── exercise1.js
│   ├── exercise2.js
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Working on the Exercises

Each exercise is located in its respective folder within the repository. To start working on an exercise, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the specific topic and exercise folder you want to work on.

2. Open the corresponding JavaScript file in your preferred code editor.

3. Read the exercise instructions provided in the initial comments of the file. You will find a description of the problem and possibly some additional guidelines there.

4. Implement your solution to the exercise within the file.

5. Run the following command to test your solution:

   ```
   node filename.js
   ```

   If test cases are provided, the results will be printed in the console.

6. Iterate on your solution until you are satisfied with the results.

7. Once you have completed the exercise, you can move on to the next one following the same steps.
